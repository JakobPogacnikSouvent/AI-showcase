                            Also known as <b>Rochambeau</b>, is a game played between two people, in which each player simultaneously choses one of three shapes.
                            Those being <b>rock</b>, <b>paper</b>, and <b>scissors</b>. Once chosen the winner is decided by the rules of paper beating rock, scissors beating paper and rock beating scissors.
                            If same shapes are selected by both players the game is a draw.

                            While in a vacum it is a game of pure chance in practice a skilled player is able to predict his opponent and have a better chance of wining.
                            As such while a random AI should have a 30% winrate against all oponents we can write a better AI by trying to predict the human mind.

                            Also known as <b>Tic-tac-toe</b> or <b>Noughts and Crosses</b> is traditionally a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
                            The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

                            Due to it's small board the game has a relativelly low number of posible games and as such is a relatively simple game to solve.
                            Even so there are different ways of approaching writing a perfect three in a row AI.

                            is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row grid.
                            The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

                            While the game has been solved since 1988, the 4,531,985,219,092 possible positions of the game board still make writing a perfect AI for this game very challenging.
